                    <p>ECJP aims to promote and empower the socio/economic livelihoods and political status of women in the
                        target Counties especially the vulnerable ones through multi-dimensions program planned to back women to
                        lobby and advocate for their rights, provide logistic and legal aid for them; conduct women awareness
                        raising programs; training of women leaders, establish direct links with women associations and women
                        rights defenders. </p>
                    <p>ECJP believes that: Justice is best served when there is a diversity of voices at the decision-making
                        table. Policies, societies, and individual lives would improve if women, especially those from
                        underprivileged backgrounds, become equal participants in leadership roles in the Counties and at the
                        National Government. The organisation also offers a forum through which womenâ€™s voices can be heard and
                        their concerns made public. </p>
