                    <p>ECJP believes that: Justice is best served when there is a diversity of voices at the decision-making
                        table. Policies, societies, and individual lives would improve if women, especially those from
                        underprivileged backgrounds, become equal participants in leadership roles in the Counties and at the
                        National Government. The organisation also offers a forum through which womenâ€™s voices can be heard and
                        their concerns made public. </p>
