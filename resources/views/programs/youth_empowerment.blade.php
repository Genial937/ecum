                    <p>ECJP funded by Han Seidel Foundation, DFID and USAID through AHADI works towards an empowered youth in
                        order to make them fruitful and responsible citizens in the country. We support youth led programs
                        geared towards the protection and promotion of their rights, social and economical well being,
                        leadership skills for civic engagement in order to ensure a self-dependent and economically vibrant
                        youth population </p>
                    <p>We create an enabling environment for the youth to strive Social-politically and ecomically. This has
                        been initiated through linking Youths in our target areas to financial institutions to gain Literacy on
                        how to access loans at the bank and how to create their own business. Modalities on Saving for
                        Transformation and Loaning have been taught to this groups and youth groups have embarked on Income
                        generation activities such in Agri-Business and Horticultural Activities. </p>
                    <p> ECJP provides a platform where young people and their communities can share skills and explore innate
                        abilities towards lasting development on a foundation of equity, justice and peace, Democracy &
                        Governance, Justice & Human Rights as well as Environment & Livelihoods.
        
                        We aim to educate as many young people in general on the culture of peace, intercultural dialogue,
                        tolerance and mutual acceptance. </p>
                    <p>ECJP aims to improve the status of youth particularly young women who have always been neglected enabling
                        them to equally and actively participate in planning, management, decision / policy making and execution
                        of their plans without any biases of gender, religion, age, class for the creation of a healthy, just,
                        peaceful, harmonized and non-violent society. </p>
                    <p>Ecumenical Centre for Justice and Peace (ECJP) is currently implementing a Youth Empowerment project in
                        partnership with the County Government of Kisumu, State Department for Youth Affairs and World Vision in
                        Kisumu County. The project was launched with a two-year pilot phase in November 2018 to cover Nyakach
                        Sub-County with proposed subsequent rollout to other sub-counties. The project is funded by DFID. </p>
