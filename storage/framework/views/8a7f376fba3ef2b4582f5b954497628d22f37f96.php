                        table. Policies, societies, and individual lives would improve if women, especially those from
                        underprivileged backgrounds, become equal participants in leadership roles in the Counties and at the
                        National Government. The organisation also offers a forum through which womenâ€™s voices can be heard and
                        their concerns made public. </p>
